# dustforceScripts
This is just a collection of whatever script files i had laying around that I have started / worked on. None of these were cleaned up for public viewing, and many of them have
janky/bad or unused code. I do try and comment a bit, but some might be confusing / misleading due to the comments originally being intended for myself alone.

Notable Scripts Include:
sprites.as is the sans script used in "Monolith"
propmove.as is a WiP moving cloud script that might or might not get done at some point. Used in "Good Morning"
j2.as/soundEffects.as are two scripts that can be used to play audio effects and music, and includes support for fading in and out like existing dustforce triggers
thunder.as is a super basic audio script that plays thunder at random intervals for a map. Used in "Petrichor"
troll.as is another basic script used in "Speed" that speeds up the game and plays a song whenever you attack
owned.as and ownedsmall.as were the script i used for "Plains" and testing "Plains" respectively. frames from the video are not included
shake.as is the script used for "Downtrill"
appleSoundEffect.as is the script which is used to play a sound effect when entering a trigger. Somewhat redundant, but was slightly different from j2/soundeffects.
the dustforceVideoOrGifToScript folder includes its own readme to explain how to use it. This script can be used to put animations into dustforce custom maps.
